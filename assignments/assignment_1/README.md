# SDS Autumn 2018, M2, Assignment 1
Daniel S. Hain (<dsh@business.aau.dk>) & Roman Jurowetzki (<roman@business.aau.dk>)
12/09/2018

# Introduction

In your first assignment, you will mainly work on the first part of the Data Science pipeline, **OSE**. In particular, you will:

-   Clean real-life data, with all its messiness (warning: Roman's scraped data included!).
-   Join data from multiple sources, and on multiple levels of aggregation
-   Explore complex data structures and relationships, guided by descriptive statistics, data-visualization, as well as other tools for exploratory data analysis, including techniques from unsupervised ML


-   Will be done in a commented notebook (see below).

# Deliverables

You are asked to deliver a Computational Notebook (R Markdown, R Notebook, or Jupyter Notebook in Python or R, the language is your choice) which answers the above-stated questions. It should have the following characteristics.

-   It should be able to run on every other computer, given it is placed in the same folder as the data. Take for granted that (as it should be for all your fellows), `R` and `Python` (Anaconda distribgution) is installed.
-   This should be possible solely by running the contained code chunk-by-chunk. A good way to test compatibility (this is not always working, unfortunately) is to run the notebook in free hosted environments (Google Colab, kaggle, Azure Notebooks).
-   If you use specific libraries (outside what we used in class) please write a note at the start of the notebook explaining what has to be installed.
-   It should solve the questions in an straightforward and elegant way.
-   It should contain enough explanations to enable your fellow students (or others on a similar level of knowledge) to clearly understand what you are doing, why, what is the outcome, how to interpret it, and how to reconstruct the exercise. Be specific and understandable, but brief.
