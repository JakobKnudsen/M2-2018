### Load packages  Standard
library(knitr) # For display of the markdown
library(tidyverse) # Collection of all the good stuff like dplyr, ggplot2 ect.
library(magrittr) # For extra-piping operators (eg. %<>%)
library(data.table) # Good format to work with large datasets
library(skimr) # Nice descriptives


### Knitr options
opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE,

               fig.align  = "center"
               )
```

Some housekeeping (again), installing necessary packages.

```{r}

new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)
rm(list.of.packages, new.packages)
```


# Introduction

## Networks... So what?
So, before we talk about networks, one thing upfront... why should we? I mean, they undeniably look pretty, don't they?

![](../media/M2_1_network.png){width=750px}

Somehow, the visualization of networks fascinates the human mind (find a short TED talk on networks and how they depict our world [here](https://www.ted.com/talks/manuel_lima_a_visual_history_of_human_knowledge)), and has even inspired an own art movement, networkism (see some examples [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/184045/Links)). 

Yet, besides that, is there an analytical value for a data scientist to bother about networks?

![](../media/M2_1_google_apple.png){width=750px}


## Networks in R
There are a number of applications designed for network analysis and the creation of network graphs such as [gephi](https://gephi.org) and [cytoscape](http://cytoscape.org). Though not specifically designed for it, R has developed into a powerful tool for network analysis. 

Significant network analysis packages for R include the [`network`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/network/index.html), [`sna`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sna/index.html), and [`igraph`](http://igraph.org) package. In addition, [Thomas Lin Pedersen](http://www.data-imaginist.com) has recently released the [`tidygraph`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidygraph/index.html) package that leverage the power of `igraph` in a manner consistent with the [`tidyverse`](http://www.tidyverse.org) workflow. Even better, he tops it up with [`ggraph`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggraph/index.html), a consistent ´ggplot2´-look-and-feel network visualization package.

R can also be used to make interactive network graphs with the [htmlwidgets framework](http://www.htmlwidgets.org) that translates R code to JavaScript. Cool implementations thereof are the [`vizNetwork`](http://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/) and [`networkD3`](http://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/) packages.

As analytical tool, I will in this lab mostly use [`igraph`](http://igraph.org). In terms of functions, it is pretty much equivalent to [`network`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/network/index.html), yet slightly more powerful, better integrated, and maintained. Since both packages have many of the same functions, better don't load them both at once.


## The Basic Structure of Networks

### The Basic Jargon
First of all, what is a network? Plainly speaking, a network is a system of elements which are connected by some relationship. The vocabulary can be a bit technical and even inconsistent between different disciplines, packages, and software. The whole system is (surprise, surprise) usually called a **network** or **graph**. The elements are commonly referred to as **nodes** (system theory jargon) or **vertices** (graph theory jargon) of a graph, while the connections are **edges** or **links**. I will mostly refer to the elements as nodes, and their connections as edges.

![](../media/M2_1_nw_illu.png){width=500px}

Generally, networks are a form of representing **relational data**. This is a very general tool that can be applied to many different types of relationships between all kind of elements. The content, meaning, and interpretation for sure depends on what elements we display, and which types of relationships. For example:


* In Social Network Analysis:
     * Nodes represent actors (which can be persons, firms and other socially constructed entities)
     * Edges represent relationships between this actors (friendship, interaction, co-affiliation, similarity ect.)
* Other types of network
     * Chemistry: Interaction between molecules
     * Computer Science: The wirld-wide-web, inter- and intranet topologies
     * Biology: Food-web, ant-hives

The possibilities to depict relational data are manifold. For example:

* Relations among persons
     * Kinship: mother of, wife of...
     * Other role based: boss of, supervisor of...
     * Cognitive/perceptual: knows, aware of what they know...
     * Affective: likes, trusts...
     * Interaction: give advice, talks to...
     * Affiliation: belong to same clubs, shares same interests...
* Relations among organizations
     * As corporate entities
     * Buy from / sell to, leases to, outsources to
     * Owns shares of, subsidiary of
     * Joint ventures, strategic alliances
     * Via their members
          * Personnel flows
          * Interlocking directorates
          * Personal friendships
          * Co-memberships
* Relations other (non-social) entities
     * Patents
          * Patents citing other patents
          * Co-occurrence of technological classes
     *Research fields
          * through citations
          * through people co-affiliated with fields
     *Sectors
          * input-output relations
          * Labor mobility
     *Technologies
          * Patent IPC classes
          * Semantic co-occurrence 


**Note: Content matters!** Each relation yields a different structure & has different effects. Theories might make sense on inter-personal, but not inter-organizational or non-social context.


### The Data-Structure of Relational Data

#### Edgelist
MOst real world relational data is to be found in what we call an **edge list**, a dataframe that contains a minimum of two columns, one column of *nodes* that are the source of a connection and another column of nodes that are the target of the connection. The nodes in the data are identified by unique IDs. If the distinction between source and target is meaningful, the network is **directed**. If the distinction is not meaningful, the network is **undirected** (more on that later). So, every row that contains the ID of one element in column 1, and the ID of another element in column 2 indicates that a connection between them exists. An edge list can also contain additional columns that describe **attributes** of the edges such as a magnitude aspect for an edge. If the edges have a magnitude attribute the graph is considered **weighted** (more on that later). Below an example ofa minimal edge list created with the `tibble()` function.

```{r edgelists}
edge_list <- tibble(from = c(1, 2, 2, 3, 4), to = c(2, 3, 4, 2, 1))
edge_list
```

Sometimes it is preferable to also create a separate node list. At its simplest, a **node list** is a data frame with a single column - which I will label as "id" - that lists the node IDs found in the edge list. The advantage of creating a separate node list is the ability to add attribute columns to the data frame such as the names of the nodes or any kind of groupings.

```{r nodelists}
library(tidyverse)
node_list <- tibble(id = 1:4, group = sample(letters[1:2], 4, replace = TRUE))
node_list
```

#### Adjacency Matrix

A second popular form of network representation is the **adjacency-matrix** (also called **socio-matrix**). It is represented as a $n*n$ matrix, where $n$ stands for the number of elements of which their relationships should be represented. The value in the cell that intercepts row $n$ and column $m$ indicates if an edge is present (=1) or absent (=0).

Tip: Given an edgelist, an adjacency matrix can easily be produced by crosstabulating:

```{r matrix}
adj_matrix <- table(edge_list) %>% as.matrix()
adj_matrix
```

#### Generating a Graph Object in `igraph`

To create an `igraph` object from an edge-list data frame we can use the `graph_from_data_frame()` function, which is a bit more straight forward than `network()`. There are three arguments in the `graph_from_data_frame()` function: d, vertices, and directed. Here, d refers to the edge list, vertices to the node list, and directed can be either `TRUE` or `FALSE` depending on whether the data is directed or undirected. By default, `graph.data.frame()` treats the first two columns of the edge list and any remaining columns as edge attributes.

```{r igraph object}
library(igraph)
g <- graph_from_data_frame(d = edge_list, vertices = node_list, directed = FALSE)
g
```

Lets inspect the resulting object. An `igraph` graph object summary reveals some interesting informations.

* First, it tells us the graph-type: undirected `UN`, or  directed `DN`
* Afterwards, the number of nodes (4), and edges (6)
* Followed by the node attributes (node level variables), which in this case are only their name (`attr: name (v/c)`)
* Lastly, a list of all existing edges. Note: `n--m` indicates an undirected, `n->m` an directed edge.

Lets take a look at the structure of the object:

```{r}
glimpse(g[[1]])
```

We see, the object has a list-format, consisting of sepperate lists for every node, containing some attributes which are irrelevant now, and an edgelist for every node, capturing its ego-network (eg., `.. ..- attr(*, "names")= chr [1:2] "2" "4"`)

We can also plot it to take a look. `igraph` object can be directly used with the `plot()` function. The results can be adjusted with a set of parameters we will discover later. It's not super pretty, therefore we will later also explore more powerfull plotting tools for rgaphs. However, its quick&dirty, so lets take it like that for now.

```{r}
plot(g)
```

Yeah, that's the graph. We  We can also use the adjacency matrix to create the same graph.


```{r}
g <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(adj_matrix, mode = "undirected")
g
```

We can inspect and manipulate the nodes via `V(g)` (V for vertices, its graph-theory slang), and edges with `E(g)`

```{r}
V(g)
E(g)
```

We can also use most of the base-R slicing&dicing.

```{r}
V(g)[1:3]
E(g)[2:4]
```

Remember, it's a list-object. So, if we just want to have the values, we have to use the double bracket `[[x]]`. 

```{r}
V(g)[[1:3]]
```

We can also use the `$` notation.

```{r}
V(g)$name
```

# Networks are coming...

## Build the graph

```{r}
rm(list=ls())

files <- list.files(path ="../data/GoT/", full.names = TRUE)
files
```

```{r}
edges.cooc.all <- fread(files[1], data.table = FALSE) 
head(edges.cooc.all)
```

So, that's what we have, a classical edgelist, with id1 in column 1 and id2 in column2. Note, the edges are in this case weighted.I don't like the sepperating "-" between in the names, lets get rid of them. 

```{r}
colnames(edges.cooc.all) <- tolower(colnames(edges.cooc.all))
edges.cooc.all %<>%
  mutate(source = gsub("-", " ", source),
         target = gsub("-", " ", target)) 
```
Ok, lets see how many characters we have overal.

```{r}
edges.cooc.all %>%
  select(-type) %>%
  gather(x, name, source:target) %>% 
  n_distinct(.$name)
```



```{r}
chars.main <- edges.cooc.all %>%
  select(-type) %>%
  gather(x, name, source:target) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(sum_weight = sum(weight)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(sum_weight)) %>%
  top_n(50)

head(chars.main)
```

So far so good, if we only go by edge weights, Tyrion is going to make it.... my favorite anyhow...

However, lets reduce our edgelist to this main characters, just to warm up and keep the overview.

```{r}
edges.cooc <- edges.cooc.all %>%
  filter(source %in% chars.main$name & target %in% chars.main$name) %>%
  select(source, target, weight)
```


```{r}
g <- graph_from_data_frame(d = edges.cooc, directed = FALSE)
g
```

Note that this co-occurence network is weighted (number of co-occurence), and undirected

```{r}
is_weighted(g)
is_directed(g)
```

## Inspect the graph

### Overal graph attributes

We already know from the summary, but we can also count the number of nodes and edges as follows:

```{r}
# Count number of edges
gsize(g)

# Count number of vertices
gorder(g)
```

We can give the graph a first plot to see what happens there. It's not pretty, but we will fine-tune it later

```{r}
plot(g)
```

We already see that some nodes are not connected (isolated), so lets drop them for our network analysis.

```{r}
g <- delete_edges(g, E(g)[weight < 20])
g <- delete_vertices(g, degree(g) == 0)
```


### Edges

```{r}
# Find all edges that include "Britt"
E(g)[[inc('Daenerys Targaryen')]]  

# Find all pairs that spend 4 or more hours together per week
E(g)[[weight >= 150]]
```


```{r}
hist(E(g)$weight)
```

### Nodes

lets see who is the most central figure in this network of interactions

#### Degree centrality
```{r}
degree(g) 
which.max(degree(g))

strength(g)
which.max(strength(g))
```

### Neighborhood of a Node

```{r}
neighbors(g, 'Robert Baratheon')
```

ego network

```{r}
ego(g, 2, "Drogo")[[1]]
```

```{r}
g.drogo <- make_ego_graph(g, 2, nodes = "Drogo")[[1]]
g.danny <- make_ego_graph(g, 2, nodes = "Daenerys Targaryen")[[1]]
```

```{r}
plot(g.drogo)
plot(g.danny)
```

Btw: To merge two graphs, just do:

```{r}
g.merge <- g.drogo + g.danny
g.merge
```




### Betweenness Centrality

```{r}
betweenness(g)
```

### Eigenvector Centrality

```{r}
eigen_centrality(g, scale = TRUE)$vector %>% round(3)
```


### graph structure


```{r}
edge_density(g)
```


```{r}
diameter(g, directed = F, weights = NA)
```


```{r}
transitivity(g)
```

```{r}
mean_distance(g, directed = F)
```

## Your turn
Ahh, you saw it comming, right? What about you explore the GoT network a bit on your own [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/danielhain/sds-2018-m2-1-intro-nw-exercise-1). Lets see how that works out!




# Directed Networks are comming...

So far so good, up to now we considered undirected networks, constructed by the amount characters co-occur. However, as you already might guess, that's not where we stop. 

There are also other relationships to which we can, and sometimes have to, assign a directionality. An obvious example here are family ties. Here, I will ose the nicely compiled dataset of the wonderful [Shirin](https://shiring.github.io) that can be found [here](https://github.com/ShirinG/blog_posts_prep/tree/master/GoT). It contains a nodelist with house-affiliations and furtehr characteristics of main characters, and a edgelist of their family relationships.


```{r}
rm(chars.main, g, g.danny, g.drogo, g.merge)
edges.fam <- readRDS("../data/GoT/union_edges.RDS")
nodes.fam <- readRDS("../data/GoT/union_characters.RDS")
```

```{r}
head(nodes.fam)
head(edges.fam)
```


```{r}
g <- graph_from_data_frame(edges.fam, 
                           vertices = nodes.fam,
                           directed = TRUE)
g
```

```{r}
plot(g)
```


For plotting the legend, I am summarizing the edge and node colors.

```{r}
color_vertices <- nodes.fam %>%
  group_by(house, color) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  filter(!is.na(color))

colors_edges <- edges.fam %>%
  group_by(type, color) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  filter(!is.na(color))
```




```{r, fig.width=15, fig.height=15}
plot(g,
     layout = layout_with_fr(g), # graph layout, more on that later
     vertex.label = gsub(" ", "\n", V(g)$name), # Just altered the label that it is in two lines
     vertex.shape = V(g)$shape, # load the predefined shape of the nodes (male/female)
     vertex.color = V(g)$color, # load the predefined color of the nodes (houses)
     vertex.size = (V(g)$popularity + 0.5) * 5, # define node-size by popularity
     vertex.frame.color = "gray", # color of the frame around the node
     vertex.label.color = "black", # color of the label
     vertex.label.cex = 0.8, # size of the label
     edge.arrow.size = 0.5, # size of the arrow
     edge.color = E(g)$color, # laod predefined edge/color (relationship)
     edge.lty = E(g)$lty) # Edge style
legend("topleft", legend = c(NA, "Node color:", as.character(color_vertices$house), NA, "Edge color:", as.character(colors_edges$type)), pch = 10,
       col = c(NA, NA, color_vertices$color, NA, NA, colors_edges$color), pt.cex = 3, cex = 2, bty = "n", ncol = 1,
       title = "") 
legend("topleft", legend = "", cex = 3, bty = "n", ncol = 1,
       title = "Game of Thrones Family Ties")
```

## Community Detection

You might have already guessed, we can very well also do a clustering exercise in networks. Here, we do not cluster nodes according to their similarity in attributes, but according to their connectivity. There are plenty of algorithms,, and we will explore further ones lateron. Most of them aim to find communities with maximum within/connectivity, and minimum between/connectivity.

However, most of them are not designed to work with directed networks. Therefore, we will convert our nice network for now to an undirected one.

```{r}
g.ud <- as.undirected(g)
```

First, we will give it a try with the **edge-betweenness** algorithm (Newman-Girvan). Here, high-betweenness edges are removed sequentially (recalculating at each step) and the best partitioning of the network is selected.

Lets take a look how it works.

```{r}
?cluster_edge_betweenness
```

And we now run it. As an hirarchical community detection technique. Since it is an hirarchical one, we can again plot a dendogram which we already know from the hirarchical clustering

```{r, fig.width=30, fig.height=15}

ceb <- cluster_edge_betweenness(g.ud) 
dendPlot(ceb, mode="hclust")
```

```{r, fig.width=20, fig.height=20}
plot(ceb, g.ud,
     vertex.frame.color = V(g)$color, # load the predefined color of the nodes (houses)
     vertex.size = (V(g)$popularity + 0.5) * 5 # define node-size by popularity) 
)
```

Lets only see how good it performs on the major houses, the rest is too small anyhow

```{r}
bind_cols(com = ceb$membership, house = V(g.ud)$house) %>%
  group_by(house) %>%
  filter(n() >= 10) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  table()
```

We see, indeed, that the communities for the most part capture the affiliation to the great houses.
